You have **TWO** ways to input the information:

1. Manually
2. Click "Open Reference File Button"



The **reference file** is supported by 知网CNKI and 读秀 by now (说不定还有更多)
**** 

**Here is the way we get the reference file:**

1. Search some topic in CNKI, Choose the essay you want, and click “导出/参考文献”

3. Then you will get a reference txt file in "下载/Downloads" folder

The first line is the type of your reference. In this case is "<u>Thesis</u>". This resource type is not supported.
Now the Citation Machine <u>only</u> support **Web/ Book/ Journal/ Newspaper/ Magazine**.

This one belong to <u>Journal</u> type. So it could be read and auto-filled by the Citation Machine. If you open the <u>wrong type</u> reference file (e.g. open Thesis reference file in Journal page), the Machine will give out a warning message and failed to fill in.

**Remember:** 

1. Use "**,**" to separate multi-authors' names and Click the **multi-author** box.
2. If there is any translator or editor, click **multi-translator/editor** box and the corresponding line will be showed.
3. Check whether there is any useless stuff like "**,**" or "**.**" after you generate the citation. Please erase it.
